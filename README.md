# Substitution Cipher Decryption Tool in C++
A C++ tool to decrypt substitution ciphers using frequency analysis, hill climbing with simulated annealing, and user-guided adjustments.

# Features
- Automatically analyzes letter frequency to generate an initial decryption key.
- Hill Climbing with Simulated Annealing which Optimizes the decryption key using a heuristic approach.
- Allows users to manually refine the substitution key for better accuracy.
- Uses English trigram frequencies to evaluate decrypted text.
- Loads trigram frequencies from a file for accurate scoring.
