# Cryptography.2
just general work for an assignment, this will be checked on and updated regulary (i hope so). :)

# INCLUDES;

# 1.Playfair Cipher Implementation in C++
A C++ implementation of the Playfair cipher, supporting customizable matrix sizes (5-9) and optional digit inclusion.

# Features
- Customizable grid size (5x5 to 9x9)
- Handles spaces and duplicate letters in plaintext
- Allows user-defined padding character
- Encrypts & decrypts messages

  

# 2.Cryptanalysis of Monoalphabetic Cipher in C++
A C++ tool to decrypt substitution ciphers using frequency analysis and manual mapping adjustments.

# Features
- Automatically analyzes letter frequency for initial decryption.
- Supports manual adjustment of substitution mappings.
- Extracts and displays decrypted words for further analysis.
- Saves decrypted output to a file (decrypted_output.txt).


# 3.Substitution Cipher Decryption Tool in C++
A C++ tool to decrypt substitution ciphers using frequency analysis, hill climbing with simulated annealing, and user-guided adjustments.

# Features
- Automatically analyzes letter frequency to generate an initial decryption key.
- Hill Climbing with Simulated Annealing which Optimizes the decryption key using a heuristic approach.
- Allows users to manually refine the substitution key for better accuracy.
- Uses English trigram frequencies to evaluate decrypted text.
- Loads trigram frequencies from a file for accurate scoring.
